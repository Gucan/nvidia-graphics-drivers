nvidia-graphics-drivers-384 (384.130-0ubuntu0.17.10.1) artful; urgency=medium

  * SECURITY UPDATE:
    - CVE-2018-6249, 2018-6253 (LP: #1771814).
  * New upstream release:
   - Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.
   - Fixed a string concatenation bug that caused libGL to accidentally try
     to create the directory "$HOME.nv" rather than "$HOME/.nv" in some cases
     where /tmp isn't accessible.
   - Increased the version numbers of the GLVND libGL, libGLESv1_CM,
     libGLESv2, and libEGL libraries, to prevent concurrently installed
     non-GLVND libraries from taking precedence in the dynamic linker cache.
   - Fixed a bug which could cause X servers that export a Video Driver ABI
     earlier than 0.8 to crash when running X11 applications which call
     XRenderAddTraps().

nvidia-graphics-drivers-384 (384.111-0ubuntu0.17.10.1) artful; urgency=medium

  * SECURITY UPDATE:
    - CVE-2017-5753 (LP: #1741807).
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce MX130
      o GeForce MX110
      o GeForce GTX 1050 Ti with Max-Q Design
      o Quadro P500
    - Fixed a regression that prevented displays connected via some
      types of passive adapters (e.g. DMS-59 to VGA or DVI) from
      working correctly. The regression was introduced with driver
      version 384.98.
    - Fixed a bug that caused Quadro M2200 GPUs to enter the lowest
      available PowerMizer performance level when under load.
  * debian/templates/control.in:
    - Add Replaces/Conflicts/Provide for libcuda-9.0-1.
      Thanks to Graham Inggs for his contribution.
