nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (302.17-0ubuntu1) quantal; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in:
    - Make sure to recommend nvidia-settings (>= version).
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GT 620M
      o GeForce GT 640M
      o GeForce GT 640M LE
      o GeForce GT 650M
      o GeForce GTX 660M
      o GeForce GTX 670M
      o GeForce GTX 675M
      o GeForce GTX 555
      o GeForce GTX 560 SE
      o GeForce GT 415
      o GeForce GTX 460 v2
      o NVS 5400M
      o NVS 310
      o Quadro 410
    - Made nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder consistent with the
      RRSetOutputPrimary and RRGetOutputPrimary RandR
      requests: changes to either nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder
      or RandR OutputPrimary will be reflected in the
      other.
    - Fixed an interaction problem between RandR 1.2,
      ConstrainCursor, and panning that prevented panning
      from working properly.
    - Fixed a bug that caused RandR RRNotify_CrtcChange
      events to not be generated when switching between
      MetaModes with the same total size but different
      layout of display devices. This bug caused some
      window managers to not update their layouts in
      response to switching same-sized MetaModes.
    - Added support for desktop panning when rotation,
      reflection, or transformation is applied to a
      display device (either through RandR or through
      the MetaMode syntax); panning would previously be
      ignored in that case.
    - Added an "EDID" property to RandR 1.2 outputs.
      This property contains the binary contents of the
      connected monitor's extended display identification
      data, which allows applications such as the GNOME
      display properties dialog to query information about
      it.
    - Fixed a bug that caused audio over HDMI to not work
      on some GPUs after querying the RandR configuration
      (e.g., `xrandr -q`).
    - Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfo" X configuration
      option to report the layout of multiple display
      devices within an X screen. This is enabled by
      default. When disabled on X servers with RandR
      1.2 support, the NVIDIA X driver will report one
      screen-sized region. When disabled on X servers
      without RandR 1.2 support, no Xinerama information
      will be reported. For backwards compatibility, the
      "NoTwinViewXineramaInfo" option disables
      nvidiaXineramaInfo.
    - Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder" X configuration
      option as a replacement for
      "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder". For backwards
      compatibility, "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder" is kept
      as a synonym for "nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder".
    - Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfoOverride" X
      configuration option as a replacement for
      "TwinViewXineramaInfoOverride". For backwards
      compatibility, "TwinViewXineramaInfoOverride" is
      kept as a synonym for "nvidiaXineramaInfoOverride".
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the use of some SLI Mosaic
      topologies.
    - Added the "MetaModeOrientation" X configuration
      option as a replacement for "TwinViewOrientation".
      "TwinViewOrientation" is kept as a synonym for
      "MetaModeOrientation", for backwards compatibility.
    - Disabled the use of certain OpenGL optimizations
      with Autodesk Maya and Mudbox, due to conflicts
      between these applications and the optimizations.
      Some performance loss in Autodesk Maya and Mudbox
      is possible, as a result.
    - Fixed a behavior issue where redundant DPMS state
      transitions were leading to unexpected screen
      blanking on DisplayPort displays.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (295.49-0ubuntu1) quantal; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPU:
      o GeForce GTX 690
    - Fixed a problem where starting, stopping, and moving
      OpenGL application windows was very slow on Quadro
      FX 4600, Quadro FX 5600, GeForce 8800 GTX, GeForce
      8800 GTS, and GeForce 8800 Ultra (LP: #982710).
    - Fixed an OpenGL performance regression which
      affected Geforce 6 and Geforce 7 series integrated
      GPUs (LP: #982485).

nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (295.40-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GT 635M
      o GeForce 610M
    - SECURITY UPDATE: privilege escalation via kernel
      memory access (LP: #959842).
    - Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort devices to
      occasionally fail to turn back on after the system
      is resumed from suspend.
    - Added a ModeValidation X configuration option token,
      "AllowNon3DVisionModes", to allow modes that are not
      optimized for NVIDIA 3D Vision to be validated on 3D
      Vision monitors.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (295.33-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GTX 680
      o GeForce GT 630M
      o GeForce GT 620
    - Fixed a VDPAU bug where decoding some H.264 streams
      would cause hardware errors on lower-end products,
      resulting in corruption and poor performance.
    - Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort audio to stop
      working after monitors are hotplugged on GeForce GT
      520.
    - Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.
    - Fixed a behavior change that prevented
      ConnectedMonitor from being usable with DisplayPort
      connectors.
    - Marked the GVO Clone mode NV-CONTROL attributes:
      NV_CTRL_GVO_DISPLAY_X_SCREEN
      NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_X
      NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_Y
      as deprecated. They will be removed in a future
      release. To display an X screen over GVO, it is
      recommended to use GVO with MetaModes, instead.
    - Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort devices to not
      be listed in Xorg.*.log.
    - Added support for 3D Vision ready displays that
      have a NVIDIA 3D Vision infrared emitter built
      inside the panel itself.
    - Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL applications to
      crash with some libc versions, such as eglibc 2.15
      (LP: #929384).
    - Fixed a bug that caused HDMI audio to stop working
      on AppleTV devices when an X server was started.
  * debian/nvidia-$flavour.postrm{.in}:
    - Make sure to remove the blacklist for hybrid
      graphics and to rebuild the initramfs (LP: #958848).

nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (295.20-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPU:
      o NVS 5200M
    - Fixed a bug that caused black areas to appear on the
      back faces of some models in Maya.
    - Fixed a bug that resulted in the printing of spurious
      loader error messages.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause X to crash after
      hotplugging displays.
    - Fixed a bug which caused face selections to be
      misrendered in Maya when using the paint selection
      tool.
    - Improved performance for interactive tools in Mudbox.
    - Added support for deleting SDI audio ancillary data
      packets when a video frame is dropped on a Quadro SDI
      Output device. See the NV_CTRL_GVO_AUDIO_BLANKING
      attribute in NVCtrl.h for details. This option can be
      set via the GvoAudioBlanking attribute in
      nvidia-settings.
  * debian/rules:
    - Make sure that nouveau is blacklisted even when nvidia
      is disabled. This is necessary in order to get hybrid
      graphics to work.
  * debian/nvidia-$(flavour).postinst{.in},
    debian/nvidia-$(flavour).prerm{.in}:
    - Make use of quirks from nvidia-common.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (290.10-0ubuntu2) precise; urgency=low

  * Rebuild against new X ABI.

 -- Alberto Milone <alberto.milone@canonical.com>  Wed, 25 Jan 2012 14:56:24 +0100

nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (290.10-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a bug that would cause OpenGL applications to
      crash when run with recent releases of glibc such as
      glibc 2.14.90.
    - Improved the performance of FBO bind operations when
      using Xinerama by ~30% in some cases.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause stereo corruption when
      driving a stereo display and a non-stereo display
      from the same GPU.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause display devices on a
      secondary GPU to get swapped between X screens when
      restarting the X server.
    - Fixed a bug that could result in line flickering in
      full-scene anti- aliasing contexts.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the physical dimensions of
      rotated monitors to be reported incorrectly.
    - Add support for the pre-VBO DrawArrays command in
      the server-side GLX driver module. The NVIDIA
      client-side GLX implementation never sends this
      command, but the server needs to support it for
      compatibility with other GLX client implementations.
    - Fixed a regression that caused blank/white windows
      when exhausting video memory on GeForce 6 and 7
      series GPUs while using composited desktops.
    - Fixed a bug that caused a crash when glDrawArrays
      was used with a non-VBO vertex attribute array to
      draw on a Xinerama screen other than screen 0 using
      an indirect GLX context.
  * debian/nvidia-$flavour.prerm.in:
    - Use the right path to remove the alternative for the
      other architecture (LP: #915461).

    - Fixed a bug causing a Linux kernel BUG when retrieving
      CPU information on some systems.
    - Fixed a bug causing some applications to hang on exit.
    - Fixed a bug causing flickering in some GPU/display
      combinations.
    - Fixed a bug that could result in poor OpenGL performance
      after hotplugging a monitor.
    - Fixed a bug causing possible text corruption when
      recovering from GPU errors.
  * debian/dkms.conf{.in}:
    - Make sure that dkms doesn't use the gold linker,
      otherwise the resulting module would cause kernel
      oops (LP: #607399).
    - Drop non functional OBSOLETE_BY variable.

      uses underscores instead of hyphens (LP: #855396).
    - Make the grub-gfxpayload file a template and blacklist
      all Nvidia cards so that Grub doesn't set a framebuffer
      which prevents recovery mode from working (LP: #854967).
    - Make it possible to add card ids to the modaliases by
      adding ids in debian/additional_card_ids.
  * debian/additional_card_ids:
    - Add support for card id 0dfc.
  * debian/nvidia-$flavour.README.Debian.in:
