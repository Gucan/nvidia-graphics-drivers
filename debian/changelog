nvidia-graphics-drivers-440 (440.59-0ubuntu0~0.19.10.1) eoan; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Disabled frame rate limiting for configurations without active
      displays when HardDPMS is enabled.
    - Restricted the maximum number of GPU Screens to one GPU Screen
      per GPU device, to prevent X from crashing when more than one
      GPU Screen is configured for a single GPU device.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash while
      exiting DPMS with HardDPMS enabled.
    - Added support for audio over DisplayPort Multi-Stream. This
      support requires Linux kernel version 5.5 or newer.
    - Updated the NVIDIA driver to allow NVIDIA High Definition Audio
      (HDA) controllers to respond to display hotplug events while
      the HDA is runtime-suspended.
    - Fixed a bug that caused DXVK titles to endlessly loop during
      shader compilation if no OpSource instruction was present.
    - Add PRIME Synchronization support for Linux kernel 5.4 and
      newer.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-440 (440.31-0ubuntu0~0.19.10.1) eoan; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER
    - Fixed a regression in the 440.26 driver that could prevent the
      NVIDIA kernel modules from building correctly on systems
      localized to a language other than English.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash when running
      applications using GLX indirect rendering.
    - Updated the Module.symvers sanity check, which is part of the
      NVIDIA kernel module build process, to accommodate the recent
      addition of a new field in the Module.symvers file format. This
      fixes the error "The Module.symvers file is missing [...]" seen
      during driver installation or DKMS rebuilds with Linux 5.4 RC
      kernels.
    - Fixed kernel module build problems with Linux kernel 5.4.0
      release candidates.
    - Updated nvidia-bug-report.sh to collect information about X
      server crashes from coredumpctl, when available.
    - Updated the nvidia-drm kernel module for compatibility with the
      removal of the DRIVER_PRIME flag in recent Linux kernel
      versions.
    - Enabled parallel GLSL shader linking by default; i.e., allow
      GL_ARB_parallel_shader_compile to work without first calling
      glMaxShaderCompilerThreadsARB().
    - Added support for HDMI 2.1 variable refresh rate (VRR) G-SYNC
      Compatible monitors on supported GPUs.For more details, see
      "Configuring Multiple Display Devices on One X Screen" in the
      README.
    - Added support for the GLX_NV_multigpu_context and
      GL_NV_gpu_multicast extensions.For more details, see the
      "Configuring SLI and Multi-GPU FrameRendering" chapter of the
      README, and the extension specifications:
      https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/NV/GLX_NV_mu
      ltigpu_context.txt
      https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/NV/NV_gpu_mu
      lticast.txt
    - Fixed a bug that prevented Vulkan applications running on
      systems configured for SLI. Vulkan applications can now run
      while SLI is enabled; however, they will only be able to use a
      single GPU.
    - Simplified the nvidia-sleep.sh sample script to no longer
      depend on unreliable detection of the current VT through X
      server logs.
    - Added EGL support for PRIME render offload. Please see the
      PRIME Render Offload chapter in the README for configuration
      details.
    - Fixed a regression introduced in 435.19.02 that would cause
      some applications which use the VK_KHR_DISPLAY extension to
      result in a segmentation fault.
    - Enabled HardDPMS by default. See the README entry on the X
      configuration option "HardDPMS" for more information.
    - Fixed a bug which caused corruption in the following DXVK
      titles:
        o Saints Row IV
        o Saints Row: The Third
    - Added VP9 decode support to the NVIDIA VDPAU driver. See the
      VDPAU Support appendix in the README for supported VP9 decoder
      profiles.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause heapUsage values reported by
      VK_EXT_memory_budget to not immediately update after
      vkFreeMemory was called.
    - Changed GPU clock management strategy to more quickly ramp down
      clocks after a drop in GPU utilization.
    - Added X configuration option, "SidebandSocketPath", which
      controls the directory in which the X driver will create a
      pathname UNIX domain socket used to communicate with the NVIDIA
      OpenGL, Vulkan and VDPAU driver components.
    - The X driver will now create a fallback pathname UNIX domain
      socket in the directory specified by the "SidebandSocketPath"
      option, or /var/run by default, which will be used by other
      NVIDIA driver components if they are unable to connect to the
      default abstract socket.This fixes a bug where graphics
      applications run within a network namespace (which prevents the
      use of abstract sockets) were unable to take advantage of some
      driver features, such as G-Sync.
    - Fall back to system memory when video memory is full for some
      driver-internal allocations. This can help fix Xid 13 and Xid
      31 cases in Vulkan applications when video memory is full.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause a blank screen on some DisplayPort
      monitors when logging in to GNOME, if the nvidia-drm kernel
      module parameter modeset=1 is specified.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented NVIDIA GPUs from entering the low-
      power D3 state when entering suspend-to-idle (s2idle). Note
      that on some systems this may expose an existing timing issue
      in the Linux kernel; see the "Known Issues and Workarounds"
      section of the "Configuring Power Management Support" chapter
      of the README for more details.
