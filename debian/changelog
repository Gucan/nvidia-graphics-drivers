nvidia-graphics-drivers-455 (455.45.01-0ubuntu0~0.20.04.1) focal; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release (LP: #1904863):
    - Fixed a bug in a Vulkan blending optimization that could
      produce incorrect results. Some of the Vulkan titles affected
      by this bug were:
        Life is Strange 2
        Shadow of the Tomb Raider
    - Fixed an issue that caused Vulkan swapchain creation to fail
      for full-screen windows when a G-SYNC monitor is connected.

  [ Kai-Heng Feng ]
  * debian/71-nvidia.rules:
    - Add rules to enable runtimepm by default.

  [ Alberto Milone ]
  * debian/add-ids-to-json-db,
    debian/additional_runtimepm_ids,
    debian/rules:
    - Make it possible to add new IDs to mark support
      for runtimepm.
