nvidia-graphics-drivers-319-updates (319.60-0ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  [ Andy Dick ]
  * debian/templates/nvidia-graphics-drivers.preinst.in:
    - Attempt uninstallation of any existing .run file
      installation before installing Debian-packaged
      driver.
  * debian/templates/nvidia-graphics-drivers.postinst.in:
    - Add libcuda.so symlinks in /usr/lib*.
  * debian/rules:
    - Conditionalize the copying of Makefile.kbuild to
      Makefile. This adds support for newer drivers,
      while maintaining support for packaging older drivers.
    - Avoid extracting unnecessary .run files. The 64-bit
      package needs both the 32- and 64-bit .run files, but
      the 32-bit package does not. Change the unpackaging
      rules to unpack only the native package by default,
      and only unpack the 32-bit x86 package on amd64.
      Also, instead of changing the .run file permissions
      to ensure that the .run file is executable, just call
      it as an argument to sh.
    - Don't assume that extracted files are writable.
      The package contents extracted from some .run file
      installers may not have write permissions enabled.
      To work around this, move files instead of copying
      them to a temporary location before running sed
      scripts, and add force flags to applicable commands.
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPU:
      o GeForce GTX 760 Ti OEM
    - Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications to
      crash during the initialization of new threads.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the GPU and Memory clock
      frequencies for some PowerMizer performance levels
      on Kepler boards to be reported incorrectly in the
      nvidia-settings control panel.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to fail to
      start on certain laptops when the boot display was
      on an external DisplayPort monitor, for example if
      the laptop was booted while the lid was closed.
    - Fixed a bug in nvidia-installer that caused the
      32-bit libGL.la libtool library file to be
      installed to the wrong location.
    - Updated the NVIDIA OpenGL driver to write temporary
      files to $TMPDIR if it is set, instead of
      unconditionally writing to /tmp (LP: #1212425).
    - Updated a fallback of writing temporary files to
      $HOME/.nvidia to use $HOME/.nv instead, as the
      latter path is already used for other NVIDIA driver
      related files.

  * debian/templates/nvidia-graphics-drivers.{links|links32}.in:
    - Create links for the new NvIFROpenGL library.
  * debian/additional_card_ids:
    - Remove card id 11C4 which is now officially supported.
  * New upstream release (LP: #1219908, LP: #1222670):
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GT 740A
      o GeForce GT 745A
      o GeForce GT 755M
      o GeForce GT 625
      o GeForce GTX 645
      o GRID K340
      o GRID K350
      o NVS 315
      o Quadro K500M
   - Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort monitors connected
     to Quadro FX 3800, 4800, or 5800 to remain off after
     DPMS.
   - Added the NVIDIA OpenGL-based Inband Frame Readback
     (NvIFROpenGL) library to the Linux driver package.
     This library provides a high performance, low latency
     interface to capture and optionally encode an
     individual OpenGL framebuffer. NvIFROpenGL captures
     pixels rendered by OpenGL only and is ideally suited
     to application capture and remoting.
   - Fixed a bug that caused applications using CUDA-GL
     interop to crash when run on X servers with Xinerama
     enabled.
   - Fixed a bug that could prevent some double-bit ECC
     errors from being properly reported.
   - Fixed a bug which could cause a blank screen when
     changing house sync settings on Quadro Kepler GPUs
     with Quadro Sync boards.
   - Fixed a bug that prevented nested loops with
     identical loop conditions in GLSL shaders from
     terminating correctly. This could cause hangs in
     applications such as Exa PowerVIZ.
   - Fixed a bug that resulted in corrupt texels when a
     previously empty texture image was specified with
     glXBindTexImageEXT. In GNOME 3, this caused
     gnome-screenshot to produce garbled window
     screenshots.
   - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash when
     querying the current mode of disabled displays.
