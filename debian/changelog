nvidia-graphics-drivers-440 (440.59-0ubuntu0.19.10.1) eoan; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Disabled frame rate limiting for configurations without active
      displays when HardDPMS is enabled.
    - Restricted the maximum number of GPU Screens to one GPU Screen
      per GPU device, to prevent X from crashing when more than one
      GPU Screen is configured for a single GPU device.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash while
      exiting DPMS with HardDPMS enabled.
    - Added support for audio over DisplayPort Multi-Stream. This
      support requires Linux kernel version 5.5 or newer.
    - Updated the NVIDIA driver to allow NVIDIA High Definition Audio
      (HDA) controllers to respond to display hotplug events while
      the HDA is runtime-suspended.
    - Fixed a bug that caused DXVK titles to endlessly loop during
      shader compilation if no OpSource instruction was present.
    - Add PRIME Synchronization support for Linux kernel 5.4 and
      newer.
