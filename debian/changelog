nvidia-graphics-drivers-352-updates (352.63-0ubuntu1) xenial; urgency=medium

  * debian/templates/dkms_nvidia.conf.in:
    - Drop buildfix_kernel_4.3.patch. The upstream code already
      includes this fix.
  * debian/substvars:
    - Add support for X ABI 20.
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      GeForce 945M
      Quadro M5000M
      Quadro M4000M
      Quadro M3000M
      Quadro M2000M
      Quadro M1000M
      Quadro M600M
      NVS 810
    - Fixed a regression that prevented DPMS from working
      correctly on some DisplayPort displays.
    - Fixed a bug that could prevent X from starting when
      configured with multiple X screens, some of which
      scan out to display devices, and some of which do not.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause texture corruption in
      some OpenGL applications when video memory is exhausted
      by a combination of simultaneously running graphical
      and compute workloads.
    - Added support for X.Org xserver ABI 20 (xorg-server 1.18).

nvidia-graphics-drivers-352-updates (352.41-0ubuntu1) wily; urgency=medium

  * debian/templates/control.in:
    - Add support for libcuda-7.5-1. Thanks to Graham Inggs for
      spotting the problem.
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GTX 950
      o Quadro M4000
      o Quadro M5000
    - Fixed a bug that caused VDPAU to only display the top
      half of a video frame when decoding and displaying
      H.265/HEVC encoded video streams.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if an
      OpenGL application tried to allocate a drawable when
      GPU-accessible memory is exhausted.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-352-updates (352.30-0ubuntu1) wily; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPU:
        Quadro M5000
        Quadro M4000
        GeForce 910M
    - Fixed a bug that caused poor video post-processing performance
      in VDPAU when operating on a large number of video streams
      simultaneously.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause an Xid error when terminating a
      video playback application using the overlay presentation queue
      in VDPAU.
    - Fixed a rare deadlock condition when running applications that
      use OpenGL in multiple threads on a Quadro GPU.
    - Fixed a kernel memory leak that occurred when looping hardware
      - accelerated video decoding with VDPAU on Maxwell-based GPUs.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if a RandR 1.4
      output provided by a Sink Output provider was selected as the
      primary output on X.Org xserver 1.17 and higher.
    - Fixed a bug that caused waiting on X Sync Fence objects in
      OpenGL to hang indefinitely in some cases.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented OpenGL from properly recovering from
      hardware errors or sync object waits that had timed out.
