nvidia-graphics-drivers-experimental-310 (310.14-0ubuntu1) quantal-proposed; urgency=low

  * Introduce experimental-310 beta flavour (LP: #1047681):
    - Implemented workarounds for two Adobe Flash bugs by
      applying libvdpau commit
      ca9e637c61e80145f0625a590c91429db67d0a40 to the
      version of libvdpau shipped with the NVIDIA driver.
    - Fixed an issue which affected the performance of
      moving windows of VDPAU applications when run in
      some composite managers.
    - Added unofficial GLX protocol support (i.e., for
      GLX indirect rendering) for the
      GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object OpenGL extension.
    - Added support for HDMI 3D Stereo with Quadro Kepler
      and later GPUs. See the documentation for the
      "Stereo" X configuration option in the README for
      details.
    - Added experimental support for OpenGL threaded
      optimizations, available through the
      __GL_THREADED_OPTIMIZATIONS environment variable.
      For more information, please refer to the
      "Threaded Optimizations" section in chapter
      "Specifying OpenGL Environment Variable Settings"
      of the README.
    - Improved performance and responsiveness of
      windowed OpenGL applications running inside a
      Unity session.
    - Added support for OpenGL 4.3.
    - Fixed a bug that caused incorrect input
      transformation after resizing an NVIDIA X screen
      with xserver ABI 12 (xorg-server 1.12) or newer.
    - Fixed a bug that caused GLX to leak memory when
      Xinerama is enabled.
    - Added support for the "Backlight" RandR output
      property for configuring the brightness of some
      notebook internal panels.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the Ubuntu Unity
      launcher panel from unhiding (LP: #1057000).
