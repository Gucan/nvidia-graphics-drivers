nvidia-graphics-drivers-367 (367.44-0ubuntu1) yakkety; urgency=medium

  * debian/templates/dkms.conf.fragment.in,
    debian/templates/dkms_nvidia.conf.in:
    - Drop patches for Linux 4.7.
  * debian/71-nvidia.rules, debian/nvidia-persistenced.service,
    debian/start-nvidia-persistenced,
    debian/stop-nvidia-persistenced,
    debian/templates/nvidia-graphics-drivers.install.in:
    - Use udev and systemd to start and to stop nvidia-persistenced,
      as opposed to using only udev. This fixes a problem with the
      daemon dying shortly after being started.
      Thanks to William Davis for providing a solution.
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o TITAN X (Pascal)
      o GeForce GTX 1060 6GB
      o GeForce GTX 1060 3GB
    - Fixed a regression that caused applications using
      indirect GLX to crash.
    - Fixed a regression introduced in 367.35 that caused
      the first modeset of the X server to display blank
      if the features requested in the X configuration file
      enabled the X driver's composition pipeline. This would
      be triggered, e.g., by MetaMode tokens such as
      ForceCompositionPipeline, ForceFullCompositionPipeline,
      Rotation, Reflection, and Transform.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL applications to
      leak open file descriptors under some circumstances.
    - Fixed a crash in the OpenGL and OpenGL ES drivers in
      situations where some of the NVIDIA device nodes were
      not accessible.
    - Fixed a crash when querying the CUDA device handle of
      an EGLDevice in a system with multiple GPUs when the
      NVIDIA UVM device node or kernel module was not
      accessible.
    - Changed the behavior of nvidia-persistenced to enable
      persistence mode by default for all GPUs when the daemon
      is started.
