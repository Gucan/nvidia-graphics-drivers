      clients using PBOs and/or VBOs when using GLX indirect
      rendering.

      screens with 'Option "UseDisplayDevice" "none"' to be
      represented incorrectly in the nvidia-settings control
      panel.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause glXSwapBuffer() to block for
      longer than necessary in multi-threaded GLX applications using
      the GLX_NV_delay_before_swap extension.

      NV_path_rendering extension to crash after a modeswitch event.
