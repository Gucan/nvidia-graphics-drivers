nvidia-graphics-drivers-430 (430.26-0ubuntu0.18.04.1) bionic; urgency=medium

  * Initial release (LP: #1834603):
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
        Quadro P520
        Quadro RTX 3000
        Quadro T1000
        Quadro T2000
    - Fixed a bug, introduced in 415.13, that caused audio over
      DisplayPort to not work in some configurations.
  * debian/templates/control.in:
    - Specify multiarch for transitional packages.
    - Add transitional packages for 418.
    - Add dependency on libnvidia-cfg1-#FLAVOUR# to nvidia-headless-no-dkms-#FLAVOUR#
      nvidia-persistenced depends on it.
  * debian/71-nvidia.rules:
    - Remove nvidia-smi from run list.
      nvidia-smi was previously used for creating device nodes when nvidia
      kernel module is being loaded. This is no longer mandatory as the device
      nodes (nvidia0 & nvidiactl) will be created by any other process linking
      to libnvidia-ml.so, e.g. nvidia-settings, when necessary.
