nvidia-graphics-drivers-331-updates (331.38-0ubuntu0.0.1) precise-proposed; urgency=medium

  [ Shih-Yuan Lee (FourDollars) ]
  * debian/nvidia_supported,
    debian/rules:
    - Add subsystem ID parsing support for LP: #1255813.

  [ Alberto Milone ]
  * debian/dkms_nvidia/patches/register-VT-switch-requirements.patch:
    - Make sure to call pm_vt_switch_{required,unregister}(), so that
      the kernel knows that the driver requires a vt switch at
      suspend/resume time. This resolves a corruption issue on resume
      from S3 (LP: #1210077).
      Thanks to NVIDIA for the patch.
  * debian/dkms_nvidia_uvm/patches/buildfix_kernel_3.12.patch,
    debian/dkms_nvidia/patches/buildfix_kernel_3.13.patch:
    - Add support for Linux 3.13 (LP: #1294163).
  * debian/substvars:
    - Add support for X ABI 15 and lts-trusty.
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for X.org xserver ABI 15 (xorg-server 1.15).
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if video memory
      is exhausted and the GPU does not support rendering to system
      memory.
    - Updated nvidia-installer to make the --multiple-kernel-modules
      option imply the --no-unified-memory option: Unified memory is
      incompatible with multiple kernel modules.
    - Updated the behavior of the nvidia-settings PowerMizer
      Preferred Mode drop-down menu, to make the setting apply
      consistently across all GPUs in an SLI group.
    - Improved the robustness of the NVIDIA X driver in scenarios
      where GPU-accessible memory for allocating pixmaps was
      exhausted.
    - Added NV-CONTROL attributes to control the brightness of the
      illuminated logos on certain graphics boards.For example, to
      turn off the illumination of the
      GEFORCE GTX
      lettering on the GeForce GTX 780, use
      nvidia-settings --assign GPULogoBrightness=0
    - Fixed a bug that prevented screen transformations from being
      applied properly when starting X.
    - GLX protocol for the following OpenGL extensions from OpenGL
      2.1 and OpenGL 3.0 have been promoted from unofficial to ARB
      approved official status:
        GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object
        GL_NV_conditional_render
        GL_ARB_map_buffer_range
        GL_EXT_texture_integer
        GL_ARB_vertex_array_object
      GL_ARB_pixel_buffer_object was the last piece of protocol
      needed to have official support for indirect rendering with all
      OpenGL 2.1 commands.
    - GLX Protocol for the miscellaneous OpenGL 3.0 commands not
      associated with specific extensions has also been promoted from
      unofficial to ARB approved status.
    - Deprecated display mask related configuration of display
      devices via NV-CONTROL and nvidia-settings.Display target
      specifications should be used instead - A display target is one
      of the display's valid names, with an optional GPU or X screen
      qualifier.
    - Deprecated the following NV-CONTROL attributes:
        NV_CTRL_CONNECTED_DISPLAYS
        NV_CTRL_ENABLED_DISPLAYS
        NV_CTRL_ASSOCIATED_DISPLAYS
        NV_CTRL_NOTEBOOK_INTERNAL_LCD
        NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MASTER
        NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SLAVES
        NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_MASTERABLE
        NV_CTRL_FRAMELOCK_SLAVEABLE
      Also, although NV_CTRL_PROBE_DISPLAYS is still operational, the
      return value has been deprecated and should not be used.
    - Added deprecation warning messages in nvidia-settings when
      deprecated attributes are used.This also includes display mask
      usage.
