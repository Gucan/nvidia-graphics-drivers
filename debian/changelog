nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (295.33-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GTX 680
      o GeForce GT 630M
      o GeForce GT 620
    - Fixed a VDPAU bug where decoding some H.264 streams
      would cause hardware errors on lower-end products,
      resulting in corruption and poor performance.
    - Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort audio to stop
      working after monitors are hotplugged on GeForce GT
      520.
    - Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.
    - Fixed a behavior change that prevented
      ConnectedMonitor from being usable with DisplayPort
      connectors.
    - Marked the GVO Clone mode NV-CONTROL attributes:
      NV_CTRL_GVO_DISPLAY_X_SCREEN
      NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_X
      NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_Y
      as deprecated. They will be removed in a future
      release. To display an X screen over GVO, it is
      recommended to use GVO with MetaModes, instead.
    - Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort devices to not
      be listed in Xorg.*.log.
    - Added support for 3D Vision ready displays that
      have a NVIDIA 3D Vision infrared emitter built
      inside the panel itself.
    - Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL applications to
      crash with some libc versions, such as eglibc 2.15
      (LP: #929384).
    - Fixed a bug that caused HDMI audio to stop working
      on AppleTV devices when an X server was started.
  * debian/nvidia-$flavour.postrm{.in}:
    - Make sure to remove the blacklist for hybrid
      graphics and to rebuild the initramfs (LP: #958848).

nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (295.20-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPU:
      o NVS 5200M
    - Fixed a bug that caused black areas to appear on the
      back faces of some models in Maya.
    - Fixed a bug that resulted in the printing of spurious
      loader error messages.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause X to crash after
      hotplugging displays.
    - Fixed a bug which caused face selections to be
      misrendered in Maya when using the paint selection
      tool.
    - Improved performance for interactive tools in Mudbox.
    - Added support for deleting SDI audio ancillary data
      packets when a video frame is dropped on a Quadro SDI
      Output device. See the NV_CTRL_GVO_AUDIO_BLANKING
      attribute in NVCtrl.h for details. This option can be
      set via the GvoAudioBlanking attribute in
      nvidia-settings.
  * debian/rules:
    - Make sure that nouveau is blacklisted even when nvidia
      is disabled. This is necessary in order to get hybrid
      graphics to work.
  * debian/nvidia-$(flavour).postinst{.in},
    debian/nvidia-$(flavour).prerm{.in}:
    - Make use of quirks from nvidia-common.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (290.10-0ubuntu2) precise; urgency=low

  * Rebuild against new X ABI.

 -- Alberto Milone <alberto.milone@canonical.com>  Wed, 25 Jan 2012 14:56:24 +0100

nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (290.10-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a bug that would cause OpenGL applications to
      crash when run with recent releases of glibc such as
      glibc 2.14.90.
    - Improved the performance of FBO bind operations when
      using Xinerama by ~30% in some cases.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause stereo corruption when
      driving a stereo display and a non-stereo display
      from the same GPU.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause display devices on a
      secondary GPU to get swapped between X screens when
      restarting the X server.
    - Fixed a bug that could result in line flickering in
      full-scene anti- aliasing contexts.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the physical dimensions of
      rotated monitors to be reported incorrectly.
    - Add support for the pre-VBO DrawArrays command in
      the server-side GLX driver module. The NVIDIA
      client-side GLX implementation never sends this
      command, but the server needs to support it for
      compatibility with other GLX client implementations.
    - Fixed a regression that caused blank/white windows
      when exhausting video memory on GeForce 6 and 7
      series GPUs while using composited desktops.
    - Fixed a bug that caused a crash when glDrawArrays
      was used with a non-VBO vertex attribute array to
      draw on a Xinerama screen other than screen 0 using
      an indirect GLX context.
  * debian/nvidia-$flavour.prerm.in:
    - Use the right path to remove the alternative for the
      other architecture (LP: #915461).

      o GeForce GT 520MX
    - Added support for xserver ABI 11 (xorg-server 1.11).
    - Fixed a bug causing a Linux kernel BUG when retrieving
      CPU information on some systems.
    - Fixed a bug causing some applications to hang on exit.
    - Fixed a bug causing flickering in some GPU/display
      combinations.
    - Fixed a bug that could result in poor OpenGL performance
      after hotplugging a monitor.
    - Fixed a bug causing possible text corruption when
      recovering from GPU errors.
  * debian/dkms.conf{.in}:
    - Make sure that dkms doesn't use the gold linker,
      otherwise the resulting module would cause kernel
      oops (LP: #607399).
    - Drop non functional OBSOLETE_BY variable.

  * debian/rules:
    - Make sure that the module alias is always correct and
      uses underscores instead of hyphens (LP: #855396).
    - Make the grub-gfxpayload file a template and blacklist
      all Nvidia cards so that Grub doesn't set a framebuffer
      which prevents recovery mode from working (LP: #854967).
    - Make it possible to add card ids to the modaliases by
      adding ids in debian/additional_card_ids.
  * debian/additional_card_ids:
    - Add support for card id 0dfc.
  * debian/nvidia-$flavour.README.Debian.in:

      drivers.
  * debian/rules:
