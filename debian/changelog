nvidia-graphics-drivers-319 (319.32-0ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  * debian/templates/control.in:
    - Add transitional packages for nvidia-310.
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GTX 760
      o GeForce 720M
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the X server to crash after
      power-cycling displays connected behind a DisplayPort 1.2
      Multi-Stream Transport hub.
    - Updated the application profile syntax to allow for
      multiple patterns within a single rule. See the README for
      details.
    - Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL programs to crash when the
      __GL_DOOM3 environment variable was set.
    - Updated the NVIDIA driver to avoid calling fork(2) to
      execute the nvidia-modprobe utility when not needed.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause Altair HyperView to hang when
      rendering animations with tensors.
    - Fixed a performance regression in MEDINA 8.2.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the OpenGL driver to hang sometimes
      when running the SpeedTree Modeler application.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause an OpenGL application to crash
      if it creates and destroys multiple threads.
    - Fixed a bug that caused corrupted window content in some
      cases when moving GLX windows with antialiasing enabled.
    - Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort devices that failed
      link training to be reported as connected rather than
      disconnected.
    - Fixed a regression that could cause a DisplayPort device
      that was connected to one connector to turn off when a
      DisplayPort device on a different connector was connected
      or disconnected.
    - On Kepler-based GPUs, improved the appearance of the
      tearing that occurs when using RandR 1.4's Source Output
      capability.While tearing is still expected, the tears
      should now appear as horizontal lines rather than more
      noticeable checkerboard or triangular shapes.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-319 (319.23-0ubuntu1) saucy; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - Add the download-sources target.
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GTX 780
    - Fixed a regression that could cause X to crash when
      querying GPU information through NV-CONTROL on multi-
      GPU systems where some GPUs failed to be initialized
      for X.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause X to crash when using
      Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) with indirect rendering.
    - Fixed RandR panning reporting when the current
      MetaMode is smaller than the X screen.
    - Added the "ForceCompositionPipeline" and
      "ForceFullCompositionPipeline" MetaMode options.
      See the README for details.
    - Added support for HDMI 4K resolutions. Using a 4K
      resolution with an HDMI display requires a Kepler
      or later GPU.
    - Added support in VDPAU for 4k resolution MPEG-1/2
      and H.264 video decoding, up to 4032x4048 for
      MPEG-1/2 and 4032x4080 for H.264, and up to 65536
      macroblocks for both.
