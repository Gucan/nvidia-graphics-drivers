nvidia-graphics-drivers-430 (430.14-0ubuntu1~19.04.2) disco; urgency=medium

  * debian/71-nvidia.rules:
    - Remove nvidia-smi from run list.
      nvidia-smi was previously used for creating device nodes when nvidia
      kernel module is being loaded. This is no longer mandatory as the device
      nodes (nvidia0 & nvidiactl) will be created by any other process linking
      to libnvidia-ml.so, e.g. nvidia-settings, when necessary.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-430 (430.14-0ubuntu1~19.04.1) disco; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Improved performance of the Vulkan title, DiRT4.
    - Added support for presentation from queue families which only
      expose VK_QUEUE_COMPUTE_BIT. This improves performance of
      Steam Play title, Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause the display to be driven at a
      low resolution when configuring PRIME display offloading with
      `nvidia-xconfig --prime`.
    - Added HEVC YUV 4:4:4 decode support to the NVIDIA VDPAU
      driver.
    - Added the new per-decoder profile capability bit
      VDP_DECODER_PROFILE_SUPPORTED_CHROMA_TYPES to the NVIDIA
      VDPAU driver.
    - Added new VdpYCbCrFormats VDP_YCBCR_FORMAT_Y_UV_444 and
      VDP_YCBCR_FORMAT_Y_U_V_444 for accessing YUV 4:4:4 surfaces
      via VdpVideoSurfaceGetBitsYCbCr() and
      VdpVideoSurfacePutBitsYCbCr() in the NVIDIA VDPAU driver.
    - Added support for creation of YUV 4:4:4 video surfaces in the
      NVIDIA VDPAU driver.
    - Raised the minimum supported X.Org xserver version to 1.7
      (video driver ABI version 6).
    - Updated the NVIDIA VDPAU driver to support allocating VDPAU
      video surfaces with explicit field or frame picture
      structure.
    - Added support for the GL_NV_vdpau_interop2 OpenGL extension,
      which allows VDPAU/OpenGL surface sharing with explicit field
      or frame picture structure. Picture structure selection by
      applications can avoid the need for implicit surface
      structure conversion by the OpenGL implementation.
