nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (304.64-0ubuntu1) raring; urgency=low

  * debian/dkms.conf.in,
    make-use-of-the-new-uapi-framework.patch,
    replace-VM_RESERVED-with-VM_DONTEXPAND-and-VM_DONTDU.patch:
    - Add support for Linux 3.7 (LP: #1075937).
  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a bug that caused the EIZO FlexScan SX2762W
      monitor to remain blank when connected via
      DisplayPort.
    - Updated nvidia-settings to save and restore
      per-monitor color correction settings when RandR
      1.2 or later is available.
    - Fixed a bug that caused too many display devices
      to appear in the X Screen page of nvidia-settings
      when SLI is enabled.
    - Fixed a bug that caused applications to stop
      rendering or the X server to hang in Xinerama
      configurations when windows were moved, resized,
      mapped, or unmapped.
    - Fixed a bug that caused poor OpenGL performance
      on GeForce 6 and 7 PCI cards.
    - Fixed a bug in nvidia-settings that made it report
      the status of ECC configuration incorrectly.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if a
      display was put into DPMS off mode and subsequently
      reenabled while screen transformations are in use.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X Resize and Rotate
      extension to be enabled when Xinerama is enabled.
      These two X extensions are incompatible and having
      them both enabled can confuse window managers such
      as KDE's kwin. RandR is now correctly disabled when
      Xinerama is enabled.
    - Fixed a bug causing OpenGL stereo applications to
      not work properly when using passive stereo modes 5
      through 9 on Quadro Fermi and newer GPUs.
    - Added support for the "Backlight" RandR output
      property for configuring the brightness of some
      notebook internal panels.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the Ubuntu Unity launcher
      panel from unhiding (LP:# 1057000).
    - Fixed a bug that caused incorrect input
      transformation after resizing an NVIDIA X screen
      with xserver ABI 12 (xorg-server 1.12) or newer.
    - Fixed a bug that caused GLX to leak memory when
      Xinerama is enabled.
    - Fixed a regression in backlight control functionality
      on some notebook configurations.
    - Fixed a performance issue with recent Linux kernels
      when allocating and freeing system memory.
    - Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented the display
      device / X screen selection menu from being displayed
      in nvidia-settings.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented X driver gamma
      manipulation from working after a VT-switch on some
      configurations.
    - Added the option --output-file to nvidia-bug-report.sh
      to allow specifying a custom filename for the log file.
    - Fixed a hang when using OpenGL programs with some SLI
      Mosaic configurations on pre-Fermi GPUs.
    - Added sections to the Supported NVIDIA GPU Products
      list for NVS, Tesla, and VGX products.
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o VGX K1
      o VGX K2
      o Tesla K20c
      o Tesla K20m

      compiled without support for DRI2.
    - Fixed a regression that broke color controls on older X
      servers.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented panning from working correctly
      after a modeswitch on some X servers with support for
      cursor constraining.
    - Gamma ramp and colormap adjustments now apply correctly
      when screen transformations such as rotation and keystone
      correction are in use.
    - Fixed RandR per-CRTC gamma persistence across modeswitches
      and VT-switches.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to sometimes hang in
      response to input events.
    - Fixed a reduction in rendering performance for core X11
      rendering on certain GPUs that occurred in the 290.series
      of releases.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented PowerMizer from working
      correctly on some boards with GDDR5 memory, such as some
      GeForce GT 240 SKUs.
    - Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL applications to not
      animate properly when a rotation or a transformation was
      applied on some older X server versions.
    - Enabled FXAA with Unified Back Buffers.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (304.32-0ubuntu1) quantal; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in, debian/rules:
    - Switch from cdbs to debhelper.
  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed security issue that allowed an exploit to
      use NVIDIA UNIX device files to map and program
      registers to redirect the VGA window. Through the
      VGA window, the exploit could access any region of
      physical system memory. This arbitrary memory
      access could then be further exploited, for
      example, to escalate user privileges (LP: #1033452).
    - Added support for xserver ABI 13 (xorg-server 1.13).
    - Fixed a bug that caused RRSetOutputPrimary requests
      to incorrectly generate BadValue errors when
      setting the primary output to None. This caused
      gnome-settings-daemon to crash after changing the
      screen configuration in response to a display
      hotplug or the display change hot-key being pressed.
    - Fixed a problem where RENDER Glyphs operations
      would exhibit severe performance issues in certain
      cases, such as when used with gradients by Cairo
      and Chromium.
    - Fixed a bug that caused X to hang when resuming
      certain DisplayPort display devices (such as Apple
      brand mini-DisplayPort to dual-link DVI adapters)
      from power-saving mode.
    - Added support for the following GPU: Tesla K10
    - Fixed a bug that caused an X screen to be extended
      to Quadro SDI Output devices by default. An X
      screen will still use an SDI Output device if it
      is the only display device available. To use a SDI
      Output device on an X screen with other display
      devices available, include the SDI Output device
      with either the "UseDisplayDevice" or "MetaMode"
      X configuration options.
    - Updated X11 modeline validation such that modes
      not defined in a display device's EDID are
      discarded if the EDID 1.3 "GTF Supported" flag is
      unset or if the EDID 1.4 "Continuous Frequency"
      flag is unset. The new "AllowNonEdidModes" token
      for the ModeValidation X configuration option can
      be used to disable this new check.
    - Fixed a bug, introduced in the 295.xx release
      series, with EDID detection on some laptop
      internal panels. This bug caused the laptop
      internal panel to show six small copies of the
      desktop.
    - Added support for FXAA, Fast Approximate
      Anti-Aliasing.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (302.17-0ubuntu1) quantal; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in:
    - Make sure to recommend nvidia-settings (>= version).
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GT 620M
      o GeForce GT 640M
      o GeForce GT 640M LE
      o GeForce GT 650M
      o GeForce GTX 660M
      o GeForce GTX 670M
      o GeForce GTX 675M
      o GeForce GTX 555
      o GeForce GTX 560 SE
      o GeForce GT 415
      o GeForce GTX 460 v2
      o NVS 5400M
      o NVS 310
      o Quadro 410
    - Made nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder consistent with the
      RRSetOutputPrimary and RRGetOutputPrimary RandR
      requests: changes to either nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder
      or RandR OutputPrimary will be reflected in the
      other.
    - Fixed an interaction problem between RandR 1.2,
      ConstrainCursor, and panning that prevented panning
      from working properly.
    - Fixed a bug that caused RandR RRNotify_CrtcChange
      events to not be generated when switching between
      MetaModes with the same total size but different
      layout of display devices. This bug caused some
      window managers to not update their layouts in
      response to switching same-sized MetaModes.
    - Added support for desktop panning when rotation,
      reflection, or transformation is applied to a
      display device (either through RandR or through
      the MetaMode syntax); panning would previously be
      ignored in that case.
    - Added an "EDID" property to RandR 1.2 outputs.
      This property contains the binary contents of the
      connected monitor's extended display identification
      data, which allows applications such as the GNOME
      display properties dialog to query information about
      it.
    - Fixed a bug that caused audio over HDMI to not work
      on some GPUs after querying the RandR configuration
      (e.g., `xrandr -q`).
    - Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfo" X configuration
      option to report the layout of multiple display
      devices within an X screen. This is enabled by
      default. When disabled on X servers with RandR
      1.2 support, the NVIDIA X driver will report one
      screen-sized region. When disabled on X servers
      without RandR 1.2 support, no Xinerama information
      will be reported. For backwards compatibility, the
      "NoTwinViewXineramaInfo" option disables
      nvidiaXineramaInfo.
    - Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder" X configuration
      option as a replacement for
      "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder". For backwards
      compatibility, "TwinViewXineramaInfoOrder" is kept
      as a synonym for "nvidiaXineramaInfoOrder".
    - Added the "nvidiaXineramaInfoOverride" X
      configuration option as a replacement for
      "TwinViewXineramaInfoOverride". For backwards
      compatibility, "TwinViewXineramaInfoOverride" is
      kept as a synonym for "nvidiaXineramaInfoOverride".
    - Fixed a bug that prevented the use of some SLI Mosaic
      topologies.
    - Added the "MetaModeOrientation" X configuration
      option as a replacement for "TwinViewOrientation".
      "TwinViewOrientation" is kept as a synonym for
      "MetaModeOrientation", for backwards compatibility.
    - Disabled the use of certain OpenGL optimizations
      with Autodesk Maya and Mudbox, due to conflicts
      between these applications and the optimizations.
      Some performance loss in Autodesk Maya and Mudbox
      is possible, as a result.
    - Fixed a behavior issue where redundant DPMS state
      transitions were leading to unexpected screen
      blanking on DisplayPort displays.

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPU:
      o GeForce GTX 690
    - Fixed a problem where starting, stopping, and moving
      OpenGL application windows was very slow on Quadro
      FX 4600, Quadro FX 5600, GeForce 8800 GTX, GeForce
      8800 GTS, and GeForce 8800 Ultra (LP: #982710).
    - Fixed an OpenGL performance regression which
      affected Geforce 6 and Geforce 7 series integrated
      GPUs (LP: #982485).

      o GeForce 610M
    - SECURITY UPDATE: privilege escalation via kernel
      memory access (LP: #959842).
    - Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort devices to
      occasionally fail to turn back on after the system
      is resumed from suspend.
    - Added a ModeValidation X configuration option token,
      "AllowNon3DVisionModes", to allow modes that are not
      optimized for NVIDIA 3D Vision to be validated on 3D
      Vision monitors.

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GTX 680
      o GeForce GT 630M
      o GeForce GT 620
    - Fixed a VDPAU bug where decoding some H.264 streams
      would cause hardware errors on lower-end products,
      resulting in corruption and poor performance.
    - Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort audio to stop
      working after monitors are hotplugged on GeForce GT
      520.
    - Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.
    - Fixed a behavior change that prevented
      ConnectedMonitor from being usable with DisplayPort
      connectors.
    - Marked the GVO Clone mode NV-CONTROL attributes:
      NV_CTRL_GVO_DISPLAY_X_SCREEN
      NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_X
      NV_CTRL_GVO_X_SCREEN_PAN_Y
      as deprecated. They will be removed in a future
      release. To display an X screen over GVO, it is
      recommended to use GVO with MetaModes, instead.
    - Fixed a bug that caused DisplayPort devices to not
      be listed in Xorg.*.log.
    - Added support for 3D Vision ready displays that
      have a NVIDIA 3D Vision infrared emitter built
      inside the panel itself.
    - Fixed a bug that caused OpenGL applications to
      crash with some libc versions, such as eglibc 2.15
      (LP: #929384).
    - Fixed a bug that caused HDMI audio to stop working
      on AppleTV devices when an X server was started.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (290.10-0ubuntu1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a bug that would cause OpenGL applications to
      crash when run with recent releases of glibc such as
      glibc 2.14.90.
    - Improved the performance of FBO bind operations when
      using Xinerama by ~30% in some cases.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause stereo corruption when
      driving a stereo display and a non-stereo display
      from the same GPU.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause display devices on a
      secondary GPU to get swapped between X screens when
      restarting the X server.
    - Fixed a bug that could result in line flickering in
      full-scene anti- aliasing contexts.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the physical dimensions of
      rotated monitors to be reported incorrectly.
    - Add support for the pre-VBO DrawArrays command in
      the server-side GLX driver module. The NVIDIA
      client-side GLX implementation never sends this
      command, but the server needs to support it for
      compatibility with other GLX client implementations.
    - Fixed a regression that caused blank/white windows
      when exhausting video memory on GeForce 6 and 7
      series GPUs while using composited desktops.
    - Fixed a bug that caused a crash when glDrawArrays
      was used with a non-VBO vertex attribute array to
      draw on a Xinerama screen other than screen 0 using
      an indirect GLX context.
  * debian/nvidia-$flavour.prerm.in:
    - Use the right path to remove the alternative for the
      other architecture (LP: #915461).

    - Make sure that dkms doesn't use the gold linker,
      otherwise the resulting module would cause kernel
      oops (LP: #607399).
    - Drop non functional OBSOLETE_BY variable.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-updates (280.13-0ubuntu4) oneiric; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - Make sure that the module alias is always correct and
      uses underscores instead of hyphens (LP: #855396).
    - Make the grub-gfxpayload file a template and blacklist
      all Nvidia cards so that Grub doesn't set a framebuffer
      which prevents recovery mode from working (LP: #854967).
    - Make it possible to add card ids to the modaliases by
      adding ids in debian/additional_card_ids.
  * debian/additional_card_ids:
    - Add support for card id 0dfc.
  * debian/nvidia-$flavour.README.Debian.in:

      drivers.
