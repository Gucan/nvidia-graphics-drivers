nvidia-graphics-drivers-361 (361.45.11-0ubuntu1) yakkety; urgency=medium

  * debian/templates/dkms_nvidia.conf.in:
    - Drop patch for Linux 4.6.
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
        Quadro M5500
    - Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented flipping from being
      enabled on systems with multiple displays.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause applications to crash when using
      the EGL_EXT_platform_device extension on a system with multiple
      GPUs.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause nvidia-installer's runtime loader
      test to fail spuriously on some systems.
    - The NVIDIA Unified Virtual Memory kernel module, nvidia-uvm.ko,
      now has a minimum kernel requirement of Linux 2.6.32. On older
      kernel versions, nvidia-uvm.ko will be compiled as a stub
      kernel module which does not provide any functionality.
    - Updated the libglvnd snapshot included in the NVIDIA driver
      package to libglvnd commit b7d75429677eecc00c3701aaa4deac1304bc51ff.
      This contains a new revision of the libglvnd ABI. The driver is not
      compatible with a libglvnd older than commit
      c5bcda3b848fe52d6ae6ef25c917431c06d62d27.
