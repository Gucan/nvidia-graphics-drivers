  [ Alberto Milone ]
  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if an OpenGL
      application tried to allocate a drawable when GPU-accessible
      memory is exhausted.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause an Xid error when terminating a
      video playback application using the overlay presentation queue
      in VDPAU.
    - Fixed a rare deadlock condition when running applications that
      use OpenGL in multiple threads on a Quadro GPU.
    - Fixed a kernel memory leak that occurred when looping hardware-
      accelerated video decoding with VDPAU on Maxwell-based GPUs.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if a RandR 1.4
      output provided by a SinkOutput provider was selected as the
      primary output on X.Org xserver 1.17 and higher.
    - Fixed a bug that caused waiting on X Sync Fence objects in
      OpenGL to hang indefinitely in some cases.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented OpenGL from properly recovering from
      hardware errors or sync object waits that had timed out.
  * SECURITY UPDATE:
    - CVE-2015-5950 (LP: #1489391).
