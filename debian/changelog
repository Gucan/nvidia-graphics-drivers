  * debian/rules:
    - Add the download-sources target.
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GTX 780
    - Fixed a regression that could cause X to crash when
      querying GPU information through NV-CONTROL on multi-
      GPU systems where some GPUs failed to be initialized
      for X.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause X to crash when using
      Vertex Buffer Objects (VBOs) with indirect rendering.
    - Fixed RandR panning reporting when the current
      MetaMode is smaller than the X screen.
    - Added the "ForceCompositionPipeline" and
      "ForceFullCompositionPipeline" MetaMode options.
      See the README for details.

      resolution with an HDMI display requires a Kepler
      or later GPU.
    - Added support in VDPAU for 4k resolution MPEG-1/2
      and H.264 video decoding, up to 4032x4048 for
      MPEG-1/2 and 4032x4080 for H.264, and up to 65536
      macroblocks for both.
