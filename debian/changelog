nvidia-graphics-drivers-304-updates (304.123-0ubuntu0.0.1) precise-proposed; urgency=medium

  * debian/substvars:
    - Add support for X ABIs 15 and 18 and for lts-trusty (LP: #1294163).
  * New upstream release:
    - Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels (LP: #1294163).
    - Fixed a bug that could result in system instability while
      restoring the VGA console.
    - Fixed an interaction problem with xserver 1.15 that
      occasionally caused OpenGL applications to continue rendering
      when they are minimized or unmapped.
    - Updated nvidia-bug-report.sh to search the systemd journal for
      X server logs and messages from the NVIDIA kernel module.
    - Added support for X.org xserver ABI 18 (xorg-server 1.16).
    - Fixed a bug that caused corruption or blank screens on monitors
      that use EDID version 1.3 or older when they are connected via
      DisplayPort on graphics boards that use external DisplayPort
      encoders, such as the Quadro FX 4800.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-304-updates (304.116-0ubuntu0.0.1) precise-proposed; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (LP: #1259237):
    - Improved compatibility with recent Linux kernels.
    - Updated the NVIDIA OpenGL driver to write temporary files to
      $TMPDIR if it is set, instead of unconditionally writing to
      /tmp (LP: #1212425).
    - Updated a fallback of writing temporary files to $HOME/.nvidia
      to use $HOME/.nv instead, as the latter path is already used
      for other NVIDIA driver related files.

  [ Alberto Milone ]
  * debian/substvars:
    - Add support for lts flavours up to saucy.
  * debian/templates/control.in:
    - Depend on lib32gcc1 [amd64], libc6-i386 [amd64]
      (LP: #1236945).
    - Drop lpia.
  * debian/templates/dkms.conf.in:
    - Drop patche for Linux 3.11.
  * debian/rules:
    - Blacklist the opposite flavour.
    - Blacklist kernel modules from the other flavours.
  * debian/templates/nvidia-graphics-drivers.dirs.in,
    debian/templates/nvidia-graphics-drivers.install.in,
    debian/templates/nvidia-graphics-drivers.override.in,
    debian/templates/nvidia-graphics-drivers.postinst.in,
    debian/nvidia-autostart.desktop.in,
    debian/ubuntu-nvidia-settings.desktop.in:
    - Remove nvidia-settings icon, desktop file, and autostart file.
      This is all provided by nvidia-settings now.
  * debian/templates/nvidia-graphics-drivers.prerm.in,
    debian/templates/nvidia-graphics-drivers.install.in,
    debian/templates/nvidia-graphics-drivers.postinst.in:
    - Disable glamoregl.
    - Do not update gmenucache any more.

  * debian/templates/nvidia-graphics-drivers.preinst.in:
    - Attempt uninstallation of any existing .run file
      installation before installing Debian-packaged
      driver.
  * debian/templates/nvidia-graphics-drivers.postinst.in:
    - Add libcuda.so symlinks in /usr/lib*.
  * debian/rules:
    - Conditionalize the copying of Makefile.kbuild to
      Makefile. This adds support for newer drivers,
      while maintaining support for packaging older drivers.
    - Avoid extracting unnecessary .run files. The 64-bit
      package needs both the 32- and 64-bit .run files, but
      the 32-bit package does not. Change the unpackaging
      rules to unpack only the native package by default,
      and only unpack the 32-bit x86 package on amd64.
      Also, instead of changing the .run file permissions
      to ensure that the .run file is executable, just call
      it as an argument to sh.
    - Don't assume that extracted files are writable.
      The package contents extracted from some .run file
      installers may not have write permissions enabled.
      To work around this, move files instead of copying
      them to a temporary location before running sed
      scripts, and add force flags to applicable commands.

      version of libvdpau shipped with the NVIDIA driver.
    - Fixed a bug in nvidia-settings that could cause the
