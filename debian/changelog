nvidia-graphics-drivers-352 (352.41-0ubuntu1) wily; urgency=medium

  * debian/templates/control.in:
    - Add support for libcuda-7.5-1. Thanks to Graham Inggs for
      spotting the problem.
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GTX 950
      o Quadro M4000
      o Quadro M5000
    - Fixed a bug that caused VDPAU to only display the top
      half of a video frame when decoding and displaying
      H.265/HEVC encoded video streams.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if an
      OpenGL application tried to allocate a drawable when
      GPU-accessible memory is exhausted.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-352 (352.30-0ubuntu1) wily; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPU:
        Quadro M5000
        Quadro M4000
        GeForce 910M
    - Fixed a bug that caused poor video post-processing performance
      in VDPAU when operating on a large number of video streams
      simultaneously.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause an Xid error when terminating a
      video playback application using the overlay presentation queue
      in VDPAU.
    - Fixed a rare deadlock condition when running applications that
      use OpenGL in multiple threads on a Quadro GPU.
    - Fixed a kernel memory leak that occurred when looping hardware
      - accelerated video decoding with VDPAU on Maxwell-based GPUs.
    - Fixed a bug that caused the X server to crash if a RandR 1.4
      output provided by a Sink Output provider was selected as the
      primary output on X.Org xserver 1.17 and higher.
    - Fixed a bug that caused waiting on X Sync Fence objects in
      OpenGL to hang indefinitely in some cases.
    - Fixed a bug that prevented OpenGL from properly recovering from
      hardware errors or sync object waits that had timed out.
