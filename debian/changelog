nvidia-graphics-drivers-310-updates (310.44-0ubuntu1) raring; urgency=low

  * debian/dkms/patches/allow_sublevel_greater_than_5.patch,
    debian/templates/dkms.conf.in:
    - Allow SUBLEVEL variables greater than 5 in the
      kernel Makefile (LP: #1166639).
  * New upstream release:
    - Fixed CVE-2013-0131: NVIDIA UNIX GPU Driver ARGB
      Cursor Buffer Overflow in "NoScanout" Mode. This
      buffer overflow, which occurred when an X client
      installed a large ARGB cursor on an X server
      running in NoScanout mode, could cause a denial
      of service (e.g., an X server segmentation fault),
      or could be exploited to achieve arbitrary code
      execution.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-310-updates (310.32-0ubuntu2) raring; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    - Allow direct assignment of package name. Thanks to
      Andy Dick <adick@nvidia.com> for the patch.
    - Use flavour-agnostic template file names. The *.in
      template files currently need to be renamed when
      switching package flavours. To facilitate package
      flavour switching, we use the flavour-agnostic
      templates nvidia-graphics-drivers-*.in in the
      debian/templates directory and generate flavour
      specific files from them.
      This work is based on the original implementation
      by Daniel Dadap <ddadap@nvidia.com>.
  * debian/templates/control.in:
    - Conflict/replace/provide xorg-driver-binary.
      Each nvidia and fglrx driver will do the same with
      xorg-driver-binary.
    - Drop any other conflicts/replaces/provides.
  * debian/templates/nvidia-graphics-drivers.README.
    Debian.in:
    - Update the documentation so as to cover the
      fact that we moved templates to debian/templates.

nvidia-graphics-drivers-310-updates (310.32-0ubuntu1) raring; urgency=low

  * debian/dkms.conf.in:
    - Do not apply buildfix_kernel_3.8.patch any more.
  * debian/rules:
    - Update URL.
  * debian/substvars:
    - Add support for xserver ABI 1.14.
  * New upstream release:
    - Added support for the following GPUs:
      o GeForce GTX 680MX
      o Tesla K20Xm
    - Fixed a bug when enabling framelock between displays
      connected to the same GPU as other displays with
      different refresh rates, which caused the latter to
      be incorrectly assigned to the framelock group.
    - Updated the reporting of HDMI 3D framerates and pixel
      clocks to be more consistent with how they are
      reported by HDMI 3D displays.
    - Fixed a bug that sometimes prevented rotation controls
      in the nvidia-settings control panel from working
      after changing resolutions.
    - Fixed a bug that could cause applications using
      GL_NV_vdpau_interop to crash during modeswitches.
    - Fixed a regression that could cause OpenGL applications
      to crash while compiling shaders.
    - Added a kernel module parameter, "NVreg_EnablePCIeGen3",
      which can be used to enable PCIe gen 3 when possible.
      Note that on many systems where the NVIDIA driver does
      not allow PCIe gen 3 by default, stability problems can
      be expected when this option is enabled: users should
      do so at their own risk.
    - Fixed a VDPAU bug that could cause the X server to hang
      when decoding some corrupted video streams.
    - Renamed VGX products to GRID products in the "Supported
      NVIDIA GPU Products" list.
    - Added support for X.org xserver ABI 14 (xorg-server 1.14).
    - Fixed libnvidia-encode.so library dependency by linking
      it with libnvcuvid.so.1 instead of libnvcuvid.so while
      creating it.
    - Improved performance of OpenGL framebuffer object binds
      with Xinerama enabled by 2000-3000% when the application's
      windows do not span screen boundaries.
    - Fix performance issues when using some versions of
      HyperMesh with Quadro GPUs.
