nvidia-graphics-drivers-340 (340.76-0ubuntu0.1) trusty-proposed; urgency=medium

  * Initial release (LP: #1465706, LP: #1431753).
  * Changes in this backport, compared to wily:
    - Try to clean up the libraries and links left by the 331 series.
    - Allow nvidia-opencl-icd-$flavour to replace nvidia-opencl-icd-331 and
      nvidia-opencl-icd-331-updates for a smooth upgrade.
